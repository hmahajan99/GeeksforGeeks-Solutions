// Approach 2 : 2 pointer approach ( Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm )

  //          |                 |
  // X->X->X->X->X->X->X->X->X->X
  // <--m-----><-----k--->^
  //                      |
  //                 slow/fast meet

// Note that before meeting the point shown above, fast was moving at twice speed.
// Distance traveled by fast pointer = 2 * (Distance traveled by slow pointer)
// (m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k)
// m -->  Distance of first node of cycle from head
// n -->  Length of cycle
// k -->  Distance of point where slow & fast meet from first node of cycle
// x -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by fast pointer before they meet first time
// y -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by slow pointer before they meet first time

// m + k = (x-2y)*n
// Which means m+k is a multiple of n. 

// So if we start moving both pointers again at same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins from head node of linked list and other pointer (say fast) begins from meeting point. 
// When slow pointer reaches beginning of loop (has made m steps), fast pointer would have made also moved m steps as they are now moving same pace. 
// Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k, they would meet at the beginning. 
// Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.

// There are two parallel roads, each containing N and M buckets, respectively. Each bucket may contain some balls. 
// The buckets on both roads are kept in such a way that they are sorted according to the number of balls in them. 
// Geek starts from the end of the road which has the bucket with a lower number of balls(i.e. if buckets are sorted in increasing order, then geek will start from the left side of the road).
// The geek can change the road only at the point of intersection(which means, buckets with the same number of balls on two roads). 
// Now you need to help Geek to collect the maximum number of balls.

// Example:
// Input:
// 1
// 5 5
// 1 4 5 6 8
// 2 3 4 6 9
// Output:
// 29

// Explanation:
// The path with maximum sum is (2,3,4)[5,6](9). Integers in [] are the buckets of first road and in () are the buckets of second road. So, max balls geek can collect is 29.

// Approach: Similar to merging 2 sorted arrays
// 1. Start withhead of both roads and find first common bucket. 
// 2. Keep track of sum of the buckets too while doing this and set head of result list based on greater sum till first common bucket.
// 3. After this till the current pointers of both roads donâ€™t reach end of road, we need to adjust the next of prev pointers based on greater sum.
// This way it can be done in-place with constant extra space.
// Time complexity of the below solution is O(n).
